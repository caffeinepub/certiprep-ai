  "summary": "All three requirements (REQ-30, REQ-31, REQ-32) appear to be implemented. Dashboard.tsx now renders certification cards first before stats/welcome content, CertificationSelector.tsx moves cards to the top with descriptive content below, and StudyMaterials.tsx places the certification card grid at the top followed by an info section. The file summaries and truncated diffs confirm this reordering was performed without altering card designs or removing existing content.",
