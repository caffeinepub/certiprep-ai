  "summary": "The diff shows only two files modified: backend/main.mo (partially, with truncation) and project_state.json. The project_state.json only tracks feature request statuses (all still 'pending'), and the backend/main.mo shows structural changes with access control imports and helpers. However, the vast majority of requirements — especially all frontend requirements (REQ-1, REQ-2, REQ-3, REQ-5, REQ-6) — show no evidence of implementation. REQ-4 (backend security audit) has partial evidence in main.mo but the diff is truncated and all items in project_state.json remain 'pending'.",

      "reason": "While backend/main.mo was modified and includes access control imports and helpers, the diff is heavily truncated. It is unclear whether all required fixes were fully applied. The project_state.json still lists this as 'pending'.",
