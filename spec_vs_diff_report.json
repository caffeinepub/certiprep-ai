  "summary": "All four requirements appear to be implemented in the diff. REQ-1 (borders on all cards) is addressed via `border-2 border-border` on cert-card components across Dashboard, CertificationSelector, and StudyMaterials. REQ-2 (sun/moon toggle) is implemented in Layout.tsx using lucide-react Sun/Moon icons. REQ-3 (uniform card sizing) is addressed via the `.cert-card` CSS class with `min-height: 280px` applied across all three pages. REQ-4 (A+ card standardization) is addressed by adding a badge pill for A+ and removing the subtitle text in StudyMaterials, Dashboard, and CertificationSelector. One minor concern: REQ-3 requires a fixed width in addition to min-height, but the `.cert-card` class only sets `min-height: 280px` without an explicit fixed width.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "Set a uniform fixed card size with both a standard min-height AND fixed width for all certification cards so card dimensions do not shift when navigating between pages.",
      "reason": "The `.cert-card` class in index.css only sets `min-height: 280px`. No fixed width is applied at the card level. Width is controlled solely by the grid layout which may differ per page, meaning card widths could differ across Dashboard, Certifications, and Study Materials pages.",
