When dark mode is active, apply a dark color scheme globally across all page elements — backgrounds, text, cards, headers, navigation, and all UI components. When light mode is active, restore the default bright/light appearance. Persist the user's theme preference to localStorage so it survives page reloads. The toggle should use the existing CSS custom properties defined in frontend/src/index.css (light and dark theme tokens) and apply the dark class to the root HTML element or body to switch themes.",
