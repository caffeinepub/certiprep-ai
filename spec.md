# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Standardize card appearance site-wide, fix the CompTIA A+ card, and replace the dark/light mode toggle with a sun/moon icon switcher.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a consistent visible border/outline to all cards on the Dashboard, Certifications, and Study Materials pages, visible in both light and dark themes
- Replace the current dark/light mode toggle in the navbar with a sun ☀️ / moon 🌙 icon button — moon shown in light mode, sun shown in dark mode
- Apply a uniform fixed width and minimum height to all certification cards across all pages so card dimensions stay consistent during navigation
- Fix the CompTIA A+ card everywhere it appears: add a bordered pill/badge to the "A+" label matching the style of other certification cards (Security+, Network+, etc.), and remove the subtitle text "Core 1 (220-1101) & Core 2 (220-1102)"

**User-visible outcome:** All cards across the site look uniform with visible borders and consistent sizing; the A+ card header matches all other certification cards; and the navbar has a clean sun/moon icon toggle for switching between light and dark mode.
